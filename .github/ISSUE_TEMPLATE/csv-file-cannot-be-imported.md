Our goal is for Assetgrid's CSV importer to be flexible enough to import any CSV file, but we know that some banks aren't exactly keen on following standards.

**Describe the issue**
What is the problem when importing the CSV file?

**Describe what is needed to resolve the issue**
What do you think it would take to be able to import the CSV file. How can it be integrated into the existing process?

**Upload a sample**
Please attach a sample CSV file that illustrates the issue. You can open CSV files in Excel and remove rows or sensitive information.
