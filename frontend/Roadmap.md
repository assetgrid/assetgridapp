- Budgets
   - A budget allows you to monitor your spending over a period and define targets for each category, so you can see how much you have left to spend.
- Bills
   - A bill represents a future expense.
   - Bills and piggy banks are fundamentally the same. They allow you to reserve money for a future purpose. This money will show as reserved, so you know you cannot spend it.
   - Bills can be recurring, meaning they are automatically created each period
   - Transactions can be linked to a bill to pay it off
   - Bills can also be used for savings. Create a bill called vacation and increment the - bill each time you want to reserve money for the vacation. When you then go on vacation you can link your vacation expenses to the bill, which will decrease it
- Future expenses, recurring expenses.
  - Another option is to create a concept of reservations. A reservation would be a transaction that has not yet occured. You can then make reports with and without reservations. Linking a transaction to a reservation will mark the reservation as fulfilled by that transaction. That could be used to mark future expenses.
